This is a cellular automaton simulation where you can create and control life-like patterns on a grid.

Instructions:
- Use the Rule Control section to define rules for cell behavior
- Enter rule codes in the input field and save them
- Random Control allows you to add random rules or reshuffle existing ones
- Use Animation Control to start, pause, or step through generations
- Color Control lets you customize the colors used in the simulation

Have fun exploring cellular automata!`;

Getting Started:
1. Click "Start" to begin the simulation
2. Use "Step" to advance one generation at a time
3. "Pause" will stop the automatic progression

Rule System:
- Rules determine how cells live, die, or reproduce
- Enter custom rules using the rule input field
- Life/Death mode toggles between life and death rules

Random Features:
- Add random rules to create unpredictable patterns
- Reshuffle existing rules for new combinations
- Flush clears all rules

Recording:
- Save animations with custom names
- Animations can be replayed later

Color Customization:
- Change the three colors used in the simulation
- Colors are applied based on cell states

For more advanced features, experiment with different rule combinations!`;
